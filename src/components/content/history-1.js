            The LASIK surgeon uses computer software to guide the IntraLase
            laser beam, which applies a series of tiny (3-micron-diameter)
            bubbles within the central layer of the cornea.

            The resulting corneal flap is created at a precise depth and
            diameter pre-determined by the surgeon. As occurs with a mechanical
            microkeratome, a small section of tissue at one edge of the flap is
            left uncut, forming a hinge that allows the surgeon to fold back the
            flap so that the cornea can be accessed and reshaped for vision
            correction.
